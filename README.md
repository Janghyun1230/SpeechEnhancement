This is an old codes which was in my drive. 

This code was written with tensorflow <= 1.4.0

The code contains
- speech data pre-processing codes (tfrecordreadwrite.py)
- differentiable STFT (Utils.py)
- Various speech enhancement models (net.py: U-Net, LSTM on Spectrogram, TasNet on waveform)
- Hybrid models (model.py)
- Various objective functions for speech enhancement (loss.py)
